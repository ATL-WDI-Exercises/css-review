# CSS Crash Course

#### Copy the snippets of code from the CSS files and paste them under their appropriate descriptions in the MD files!

The `.md` files tell you what different snippets of CSS will accomplish. All the CSS is in the `.css` files -- but it's in the wrong order.

## To solve this...

First, look at the words used in the CSS snippets. What might the words actually mean? For instance, if you see `background-color:red`, it's pretty obvious what that does.

If you're not sure, open the provided `index.html` file in your web browser and try copying and pasting the snippet into the section marked `PUT YOUR CSS HERE`. Save the `.html` file and "Refresh" the page in your browser to see what changes have been applied.

If that still doesn't clarify things, try Googling either the description, or the name of the CSS property in question (e.g. "CSS background-color").

## What is "el"?

"El" is short for "element". Often, "el" is used in Javascript to refer to a certain element. In this case, when you're told to "do something with el," it means "do something with an element with the class of 'el'".

## Hint

If you're changing the CSS but everything looks the same in the browser, try resizing your window and/or adding some more CSS to make the edges of the elements more visible.

## The files are here:

- [Positioning descriptions](positioning.md)
  - [Positioning code](positioning.css)
- [Sizing descriptions](sizing.md)
  - [Sizing code](sizing.css)
- [Selectors descriptions](selectors.md)
  - [Selectors code](selectors.css)
